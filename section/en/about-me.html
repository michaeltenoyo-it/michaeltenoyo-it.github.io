        I am a humble, honest, and cheerful person in daily life. I am very responsible at what i am doing, creative, and indulgent. As a professional, i can work in groups, appreciate the work of others, be patient in working together, love to teach what i know but also learn something from others, a good listener, and open minded. "Always be humble to learn something new" have always been my motto to be less cocky with others in terms of skills, i believe everyone has their own skills and greatness that I dont have. I love to learn something new that excites me, and i believe i am a fast,committed, and disciplined learner from my study experience. <br><br>
        I am also a religious person which I am Christian, where the fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline. I'm also a caring person in which I can feel someone else's burden and sadness and I always want to help them as much as I can.
